C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located in the U.S.A. Dennis Ritchie is known as the founder of the c language. It was developed to overcome the problems of previous languages such as B, BCPL, etc.<br><br>
This repository is the collection of C Programs that has been done While Learning C as well as the collection of the program that were done while solving heavy Challenges. 

<h2><b>NOTE<b>:- All the Notes are Included inside the Programs. </h2>

This repo has divided into three main categories that covers:-

1. <u>Learning Sections</u>:- This section have 11 categories contaning all the programs that will help you to understand all the Basic as well as Advance Concepts of C programming. <br>

2. <u>Challenges</u>:- This Section Contains 11 Practice Sets which is Depend on all the 11 Learning sections. You may have a look on it.<br>

3. <u>Projects</u>:- This Section Contains the Projects releated to C programming.<br>
